/* While JS could be used for the sticky card, modern CSS is more efficient.
  Tailwind provides `sticky` and `top-*` classes which are used directly in the HTML.
  This ensures the booking card on apartment pages scrolls with the user until its container ends.
  No extra CSS is needed here because it's handled by Tailwind classes like `sticky top-28`.
